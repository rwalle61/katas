# Tic-Tac-Toe

Rules:

- X always goes first
- Players alternate placing X's and O's on the board
- Players cannot play on a played position
- A player with three X's or O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player achieves three in a row, the game is a draw
