# Characterization Tests on Gilded Rose Kata by Emily Bache

Add characterization tests to the GildedRose class. Try to name tests from a business perspective, in a way that describes what the code is doing.

As with our first approach to testing, remember the degrees of freedom; before moving to the next exercises, stay in a behavior until you have characterized it fully.

You can find the repository for your language of choice on Emilyâ€™s public repository here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata.
