## Overview

This repo contains my solutions to clean code katas, for example some I've come across in Agile Technical Practices Distilled.

The main branch is a JavaScript template for starting a new kata. The other branches contain the code for the katas - one branch per kata.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <REPO>
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn test # starts Jest watch mode
```
