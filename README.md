# Katas

Here are my solutions to clean code katas, such as those in Agile Technical Practices Distilled.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone <REPO>
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn test # starts Jest watch mode
```

The solutions to some katas can be run in the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
ts-node ./src/<KATA>/main.ts
```
